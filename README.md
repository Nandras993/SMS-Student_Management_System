# About this project:

I created this software during the programming course "The Python Mega Course" made by Ardit Sulce on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/

This app was created with PyQt6 and using SQLite and object-oriented programming.

This app showcases how oyu can use the gui capabilities of PyQt6 to interact with SQL databases, in this case in the form of a student managing software. You can add, modify and remove student data from it, easy to handle with human-friendly ui.

### Disclaimer:

The student data shown in the software is purely fictional and have no relation with any real world data. This is only a showcase of python programming.
